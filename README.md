Title : Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Description : Developed an advanced image classification system utilizing Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs) to categorize images into predefined classes. The project involved designing a 
custom CNN architecture, including multiple convolutional and pooling layers to effectively extract 
features from the images. Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, I preprocessed a dataset of over 10,000 
images, implementing techniques such as normalization and data augmentation to enhance model 
robustness. The model was trained with GPU acceleration, achieving an accuracy of 92% on the test 
set. Key insights included the impact of layer depth and dropout rates on performance. This project 
demonstrates the ability to apply deep learning techniques to real-world image classification 
problems, showcasing practical skills in model design, training, and evaluation. The developed model 
was integrated into a web application, providing users with an intuitive interface for real-time image 
classification, thus bridging the gap between complex machine learning algorithms and user-friendly 
applications.
